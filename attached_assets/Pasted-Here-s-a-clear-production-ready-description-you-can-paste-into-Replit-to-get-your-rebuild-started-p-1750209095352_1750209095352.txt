Here‚Äôs a clear, production-ready description you can paste into Replit to get your rebuild started properly:

‚∏ª

Project Name: Seggs.Life Studio
Framework: Next.js + Firebase + Tailwind CSS
Stack: Vite + TypeScript + Firebase Auth + Firestore + Gemini AI (via Google GenAI SDK)

‚∏ª

üß† Description for Replit:

I‚Äôm building a Next.js app called Seggs.Life Studio, a tasteful, AI-powered intimacy and relationship platform for couples and solo users.

The app must include:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ A beautiful landing page with a hero section, tagline, buttons (‚ÄúStart Your Journey‚Äù, ‚ÄúSign In‚Äù), and safe imagery.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ An embedded SeggsyBot chat interface (powered by Gemini / OpenAI logic).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ A members dashboard with Tailwind-style card navigation for:
	‚Ä¢	Intimacy Tracking
	‚Ä¢	AI-Powered Suggestions
	‚Ä¢	Blueprint Results
	‚Ä¢	Partner Connect
	‚Ä¢	Full Assessments
	‚Ä¢	Personalization
	‚Ä¢	Settings
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ All backend data (user auth, suggestions, mood logs, partner data, etc.) to be stored in Firebase (Firestore + Auth).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Include Stripe logic (billing per couple) and Gemini API integration via @google/generative-ai.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ UI must be mobile responsive, use modern Tailwind, and support environment variables (.env or Firebase secrets).

‚∏ª

üîê Secrets Required:

These env vars must be handled securely:

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID

GEMINI_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
NEXTAUTH_SECRET
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL


‚∏ª

üî• Development Goals:
	‚Ä¢	Build frontend first using mock data
	‚Ä¢	Skip Firebase integration for now
	‚Ä¢	Use src/lib/firebase.ts as the config reference
	‚Ä¢	Use Gemini SDK to simulate responses inside src/lib/gemini.ts
	‚Ä¢	Ensure dashboard renders without errors even if data is mocked
	‚Ä¢	Do not fail on missing .env ‚Äî fallback to hardcoded demo values in dev

‚∏ª

You can copy and paste this into your Replit prompt or workspace setup and say:

‚ÄúStart building this frontend. Use Next.js + Tailwind. Mock any Firebase or AI for now.‚Äù

Let me know when you‚Äôre ready to plug Firebase or Gemini in properly ‚Äî I‚Äôll walk you through it.
