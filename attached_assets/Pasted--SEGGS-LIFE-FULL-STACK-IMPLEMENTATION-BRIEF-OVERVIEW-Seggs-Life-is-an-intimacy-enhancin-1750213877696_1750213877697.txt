## 🔐 CORE RULES FOR DEVELOPMENT

1. **NEVER alter or delete the public landing page (index.html or `/public`)**
2. **NEVER use mood tracking, emotion logging, or psychological metrics**
3. **Constrain all AI use to Erotic Blueprint logic**
4. **Brand palette only (Cream, Blush Pink, Slate, Brown)**
5. **Focus on privacy-first design, no unnecessary tracking**
6. **User should always know where they are in the app**

## 🧠 MEMBERS FLOW

### ✅ **Signup/Login (Firebase Auth)**

* Firebase Email/Password
* Store user in `users/{uid}` with `displayName`, `blueprintStatus`, `linkedPartner`, `spicinessLevel`, `identity`

### 🔮 **Blueprint Quiz (/blueprint)**

* 25-question quiz
* Each 5 questions maps to 1 Blueprint type (Energetic, Sensual, Sexual, Kinky, Shapeshifter)
* After completion, store results in `users/{uid}`:

```json
{
  "topBlueprint": "Sensual",
  "scores": {
    "Sensual": 8,
    "Energetic": 6,
    "Sexual": 4,
    "Kinky": 3,
    "Shapeshifter": 2
  }
}
```

### 🔗 **Partner Sync (/partner-connect)**

* User can generate an invite code (e.g., `ABC-123`) stored in `inviteCodes/{code}` with their UID
* Invited partner enters code, and both UIDs are linked
* Update both `users/{uid}` with `linkedPartner: <partnerUid>`

---

## 💡 BOUDOIR IDEA GENERATOR (/boudoir)

### 🌶️ **Spiciness Levels:**

* `1`: Safe, playful, lighthearted
* `2`: Flirty, suggestive, sweet
* `3`: Cheeky, bold, romantic
* `4`: Sensual, physical, intense
* `5`: Erotic, daring, but still elegant

### 📤 **Gemini Prompt Example:**

```
User Identity: Female
Top Blueprint: Sensual
Spiciness Level: 3
Topic: Massage & Touch
Partner Blueprint: Kinky

Create 1 intimacy idea. Make it creative, emotionally intelligent, non-cringe. Do not repeat topic name. Adapt tone to spiciness level.
